Trazabilidad en Uruguay

In Uruguay we have the cattle roundup with a numerical device of 8 numbers.
These numbers are obtained by reading through a cane.
After doing this, we can download a .txt file from the cane.

With this program we can compare different readings, know the number of animals read and generate new files.
